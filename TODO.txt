Nothing. All done!

future improvements:
    - improve variable scope detection when passing as arguments
    - improve scopes (make them block level, not function level)
    - add scanf_ library function to Qlib
    - add abstraction to register saving
    - add AST and plug code generation there*

*very unlikely.
